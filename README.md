This code takes User inputted data either from extarnal txt file or input from terminal.

Data in external file needs to be formated as follows:
  one line == one string record that is ended by '\n' (new line / enter) (do not use comma ',' to seperate records)
  you can use spaces and other basic characters
  each record can at most be as logn as defined MAX_LENGTH otherwise the program will end
  you can have more records than defined MAX_LINES but the program will ignore them

When inputting by hand from terminal make sure to use Ctrl + D to simulate EOF.

Program is case insensitive.

You can change the defined values in code to suit your needs. (line 64 and 65)
